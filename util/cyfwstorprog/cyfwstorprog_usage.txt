                                 EZ-USB FX3/FX3S SDK
                                     VERSION 1.3

  cyfwstorprog.exe
  ----------------

  This is a Windows utility to program the FX3S firmware binary onto an
  SD card or eMMC device connected to the S0 port of the FX3S device, as
  preparation to get the FX3S device booting from the storage device.

  This utility makes use of a firmware binary called CyStorBootWriter.img
  which is located in the same folder. This firmware binary enumerates as
  a USB mass storage class device, and provides a set of SCSI vendor specific
  commands to program the storage device contents.

  Usage:
  ------
  cyfwstorprog.exe -vid:<VID> -pid:<PID> -img:<FW_Image>
      [-bootp:<Boot_Part_Location>] [-nuserp:<Num_UserArea_Partitions>]
      [-psizes:<PartitionSizes>][-sleep:<Sleep_Time>]

  or

  cyfwstorprog.exe -vid:<VID> -pid:<PID> -delpart

  or

  cyfwstorprog.exe -vid:<VID> -pid:<PID> -disponly

    where
    <VID> is the hex Vendor ID of the device being programmed. Typically 04B4.

    <PID> is the enumerated Product ID of the device being programmed.
          Check this Value from the Device Manager or using the
          Cypress USB Control Centre.

    <FW_Image> is the binary image to be stored on the storage device.
                The file should be in the same folder as the programming
                application and complete file name should be provided.
                e.g.: abcd.img

    <Boot_Part_Location> is the location where FW is to be programmed.
        Optional setting. Defaults to 'user'.

        Valid Values:
            boot1: Write firmware to eMMC/MMC BOOT Area Partition 1.
                   The firmware is written starting sector 0 of the partition.

            boot2: Write firmware to eMMC/MMC BOOT Area Partition 2.
                   The firmware is written starting sector 0 of the partition.

            user : Write firmware to a FX3S virtual boot partition in the
                   User Data Area (Default Value). A user area partition of
                   0x2800 Sectors is reserved as boot area at the top of the
                   user data area (Physical Sectors 0-0x27FF).
                   The Primary copy of the firmware is written to
                   Logical Address 0, and the backup copy is written to
                   Logical Address 0x400. If data at both addresses
                   (LBA 0x0000 and LBA 0x0400) is corrupt, the device will
                   normally fallback to USB for firmware download.

        WARNING: The FX3S SDK API partition management APIs
                 CyU3PSibPartitionStorage and  CyU3PSibRemovePartition will
                 cause the boot partition header to be overwritten and will
                 cause the device to fail booting from storage if using User
                 Area Virtual Boot Partitions.

    <Num_UserArea_Partitions> is the number of non-boot partitions requested.
        This can be a maximum of 3 on cards without boot1/boot2 areas.
        This will be a maximum of 2 on cards with boot1/boot2 areas.

        The total number of partitions on the storage device is 4 (including
        the boot1/boot2 partitions(if any), the user area boot partition (if
        any) and the user area data partitions (if any).

        Max(UserAreaPartitions) = 4 - (NumBoot1Partitions + NumBoot2Partitions
            + NumUserAreaBootPartitons)

        The number of UserArea partitons will be set to the lower of
        Max(UserAreaPartitions) and Num_UserArea_Partitions requested.
        If a value is not specified, a default value of 1 user area partition
        will be assumed.

    <PartitionSizes> is the size for any user area partitions created. This
        is a list of values separated by the # character (10000#20000#0) which
        are used as sizes (number of blocks) for the User area partitions
        request using <Num_UserArea_Partitions>.
        The last user area partition size is always set to whatever is
        remaining on the card and not the value specified (and so is the only
        value which should be set to 0). By default, the partition sizes is
        set equally across all remaining user area partitions.

    <Sleep_Time> is the time the application will wait after downloading the
        programming firmware (CyStorBootWriter.img which should be in the same
        path as the application) for the programming partition to be
        enumerated as a storage partition.
        The programming partition is a virtual partition and should not be
        operated upon by the user except via the programming tool
        (cyfwstorprog.exe).

    -delpart is used if the only operation required is to delete all user
        area partitions on the device. This operation will remove all FX3
        partition headers and leave the device with a single data area
        consisting of all user area sectors of the device.
        This command does not remove the MMC Boot Partition 1
        or Boot Partition 2.

     -disponly is used if the only operation required is to view existing
        partitions on the storage device. This command does not modify any
        of the partitions on the device.

  Usage Examples:
  --------------------

  1. Program the firmware binary in test1.img to Boot Partition 1 on the MMC
     device. Divide the USER data area on the MMC device into two partitions
     with the first partition size being 1000000 sectors.

     cyfwstorprog.exe -vid:04B4 -pid:00F3 -img:test1.img -bootp:boot1 -nuserp:2
                      -psizes:1000000#0 -sleep:20

  2. Program the firmware binary in test1.img to Boot Partition 2, and divide
     the user data area into two equal partitions.

     cyfwstorprog.exe -vid:04B4 -pid:00F3 -img:test1.img -bootp:boot2 -nuserp:2

  3. Program the firmware binary in test1.img to Boot partition 1. No changes
     are to be made to the user data area.

     cyfwstorprog.exe -vid:04B4 -pid:00F3 -img:test1.img -bootp:boot1

  4. Program the firmware binary in test1.img to a virtual partition created
     in the user data area. Leave the rest of the user data area as a single
     user partition.

     cyfwstorprog.exe -vid:04B4 -pid:00F3 -img:test1.img -sleep:20

  5. Delete all partitions in the user data area, including any boot partitions.

     cyfwstorprog.exe -vid:04B4 -pid:00F3 -delpart

  6. Display the current set of partitions (boot and user) present on the storage
     device.

     cyfwstorprog.exe -vid:04B4 -pid:00F3 -disponly
